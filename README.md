## Sorry!
  I am so sorry that I'm a student, and sadly trapped in school, many times I plan that I can work hard at school, as soon as I return home, I code. **But**, I'm a good sleeper...
## Thanks
  Thanks my old computer.
## How does it works??
### First of All
  Make sure you're using a ***Windows***(eh, yeah).
### Pre-work
  Drag your message-send window(sorry, I like talk in this) to the rightest side of the desktop, as you see, it'll covers half part of the screen, yep! ~~(Don't worry I'll soon deprecation this suck design)~~
### START
  Run the program(with a cute bomb as icon), follow the instruction(input what you want to send, support English, Chinese, space and everyting you can input in the console), finally press Enter, ***BOMB***
### How to Stop
  The program will keep running if you do not stop it, it will control the click, the keyboard, so we must stop it when the sending shoud be stopped, we press *"SHIFT"* to stop.(you see, the instruction has been printed in the console)
### Embarrassing things
  ~~I move your mouse to 803,687 of the desktop,(where your text editor of the message window) so, during sending, you cannot use your mouse.~~
